# Contributing

Welcome! Make sure to add tests if you're contributing. If you're adding a new
option, make sure it is parsed correctly by writing a unit test in
`test/unit.spec.js`.  Also, add a new fixture to `fixtures` that demos the new
option, and add a corresponding test in `test/integ.spec.js` to test its output.
Make sure to update the README while you're at it.
